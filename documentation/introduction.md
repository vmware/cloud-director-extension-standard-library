## Audience
The intended audience for this guide includes developers, system administrators, and Cloud Service Providers looking to extend and tailor the VMware Cloud Director environment to meet specific business requirements.

## Structure of the Guide
The VMware Cloud Director Extensibility Development Guide is organized into two main sections:

### VMware Cloud Director Extension SDK
Extensions are bundled within what we refer to as Solution Add-Ons, which are installed in VMware Cloud Director and follow a carefully defined and controlled lifecycle. These add-ons are made up of different parts that use the features of the Extensibility Platform. In this section, you will discover how to develop, construct, and deploy them.

### VMware Cloud Director Extensibility Platform
The Extensibility Platform introduces the capabilities that enable developers and CSPs to build and offer additional cloud services. It also highlights the relationship between Solution Add-ons and the broader capabilities of the Extensibility Platform. In this section, you will access detailed technical guides that offer in-depth information on each capability.
