# Defined Entities Landing Page

This page contains links to every part of the Defined Entity Documentation. Defined Entities aim to represent entities and schemas that are not present in the default vCD objects. In vCloud Director, the term "entities" refers to the objects that users can create, manage, and interact with. VMs, Organizations, Users, and Provider vDCs are all examples of entities. Entity instances can be represented as a URN within vCD, and have common characteristics like name, type, and ownership.
